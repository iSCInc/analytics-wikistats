These lists are maintained manually:

Once a private wiki got added to original dblist file inadvertently, 
which required major cleanup operation across csv files,
so I'd rather vet new wiki codes myself. 

Update Jan 2012: 
As these files are updated by script (to sort wikis by size on each run) 
which causes git warnings, there is now a folder 'master copy' 
Update those manually and copy to this folder
